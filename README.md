# Predicting-Customer-churn-in-Telecom-industry

**Background:** Because the telecoms industry is always battling its competitors for customer 
retention, it has become a hotspot of machine learning and data mining research. Customers' 
churn patterns must be regularly monitored and properly tracked, which necessitates the 
deployment of a systematic churn prediction model. Because customer turnover has such a 
direct influence on income, companies are striving to develop techniques to predict it. This is 
especially true in the telecom business.

**Aims:** The study aims to compare different machine learning algorithms in developing a 
predictive model for telecom industry. Also, to observe how differently sampled datasets affect 
the overall prediction accuracy achieved by these algorithms. Finally, to find which variables 
affect the churning of customers from the available dataset.

**Methods:** Knime Data Analytics Platform is used to implement different machine learning 
algorithms. Decision tree, Random forest, Na√Øve bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost tree 
and MLP are the algorithms used for this study. The dataset used is further randomly under
sampled and Oversampled using SMOTE. The dataset achieving best results are further boosted 
using AdaBoost.SAMME method with upto 100 iterations.
